# Auto install Seafile Server CE* and PRO**

These installers offer a quick and easy way to set up a production ready Seafile Server using MariaDB, Memcached and NGINX as a reverse proxy in under 5 minutes.

\* Community Edition
** Professional Edition

## What's it for?

Install the [Seafile Server](http://seafile.com/en/home/) in a standard and more secure manner then our current out of the box setup scripts offer.


## Supported OS

Just select the corresponding installer for your OS. All scripts are meant to run with the bare minimum OS setup. We strongly suggest not installing Seafile server besides desktop environment or hosting panels like Plesk, ISPConfig, etc. Professional installations which don't follow our setup suggestions, don't qualify for official support. Keep this in mind.

### Minimal installations only!

1. Ubuntu 16.04
2. CentOS 7

## Caution
Never run these scripts on a production server. They are more or less a one trick pony and could seriously damage production systems. Run it only once and
delete it afterwards. If something goes wrong, restart with a fresh machine.

As a precaution I have added a few simple checks to abort installation if any of these fails:

1. Check if you're running this script as root. If not, abort.
2. Check if the user "seafile" exists. If yes, abort.
3. Check if the directory "/opt/seafile" exists. If yes, abort.

seafile

***How do I update Seafile?***
You will have to handle Seafile updates/upgrades manually after the initial installation. Consult http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html on how to upgrade Seafile.

To login as the Seafile users run `su - seafile -s /bin/bash` and then proceed with the update procedure as usual.

BTW: Ideas on how to automate upgrades are very welcome!

1. Delete installer script. You wont need it anymore and might even seriously damage your system if you run it again.
2. Follow the suggested steps at the end of the installation to finalize your Seafile server installation.

## Troubleshooting
If your installation did not finish successfully, check `/opt/seafile/[installer_name]_installation.log` for errors.
